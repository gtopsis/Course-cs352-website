## Website for the course CS352


Static website for the course cs352 (year 2017-2018) in Computer Science department at UOC. It was serving the content (lectures, tutorials, assignments and course project) of the course only to this course's participants (students, teaching assoistants, proffesor) who acquire a specific password.

Used the Agency bootstrap template (https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/).

*Note*: Currently, the website of this course has been extended a bit and so, I present a screenshot of the work I had done back then. ðŸ‘‡

<!-- There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.
